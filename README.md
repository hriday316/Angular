# Angular Learning — Practice Projects

Repository of small Angular projects and exercises used for learning and hands-on practice. Each folder contains a self-contained Angular application demonstrating specific concepts and patterns.


## Overview
This workspace collects course-style exercises and starter projects to practice Angular fundamentals: components, data binding, forms, change detection, services, and small UI patterns.

## Projects
- `02-investment-calculator` — Investment calculator tutorial (inputs, results, basic styling).
- `03-starting-project` — Starter dashboard project (components & templates deep drive)
- `04-custom-two-way-binding-project` — Demonstrates creating custom two-way bindings and component communication.

Each project is an independent Angular app (contains its own `package.json`).


## How to run a project
Open a terminal and change to the project folder you want to run. Example steps:

```bash
cd "02-investment-calculator"
npm install
# Run using the local Angular CLI
npx ng serve --open
```

## Build for production
From the project folder:

```bash
npx ng build --prod
```
